This app was created using the GIPHY API. It uses a combination of HTML, jQuery and JavaScript. 

Each button will trigger a call to the GIPHY API to gather 10 GIFs and their ratings. You can add additional buttons with any category you would like through the search feature on the right side of the page. 

Have fun!
